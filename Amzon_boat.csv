4.0,A superb product at this price range.,Must buy if you are looking for an earbud. But the ₹1200 is a little over priced. If theres an offer for below ₹1000 must try.,7 November 2022

4.0,Reviewing after using it for a year,I bought these airdopes in oct 2021 and exactly after a year few days in oct 2022 they stopped working out of nowhere. They worked great for a year. I had no issue no problems and i took care of them too idk why it suddenly stopped working. The problem started when it stopped charging 2-3 days back and the person whom i took it to repair said that jack is gone. Although it worked amazing for me for a year but then also only one issue was that on call the receiver was not able to hear my voice properly and even if i send voice chats. Overall I didn’t expect it to stop working like this. Short life span maybe! Hope it helps if someone is willing to buy!,21 October 2022

4.0,Headphone that offers convenience,Sound quality is not great but it offers convenience. Pairs quickly with almost any device you want. Sometimes they do fall off especially in dry climate like in ac rooms/offices. Looks great too.

But the other side won't be able to hear you if you're using this outdoor.Bass is good.It doesn't fit properly in the ear, it keeps falling from my ear.

3.0,Not to the quality as expected,Liked on its battery and charge life. Ease on ears.Easy to carry in pockets.Sound and bass also microphone is not as expected on quality. Much of noise is not cancelled at all. Its like my voice is also cancelled.Have to keep in full volume to listen to a normal sound music which is not good.My sister had purchased same headset which had in one percent volume a full good quality sound hence I had bought the same one.But I did not in same quality as my sister had got.I had no choice but to adjust with it.The quality changes when you make up as a brand that is what I had realised.Bit disappointed as music was my most happiness and I was worth to pay anything which is fair price for a headset and to its quality.But not expected enough on it.Thank you!,Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 22 August 2022

5.0,Good airdope in a very low budget,Writing review after 3 months of regular usage.1. Fairly good sound quality in this price range.2. Bass boosting quality is also good.3. Notice cancellation is really great. Any sound below 120dB (sound of an aeroplane) is blocked.4. The case takes around 2 and half hours to charge from 0% to 100%.5. Each airdope has a runtime of 3 hours or more.6. The case can charge the airdopes for atleast 4 times to 100%.7. Do not use the aordopes while driving or walking on road. It has a great noise cancellation and you wont be able to hear the minimum noisenof traffic which can lead to accident.,27 October 2022

5.0,Being an Audiophile and an iPhone user this device is a great alternative to Apple airpods.,"I had been using iPhone XR since November 2020 and bought Apple Airpods even before buying this model. Being an audiophile (An audiophile is a person who is enthusiastic about high-fidelity sound reproduction. An audiophile seeks to reproduce the sound of a live musical performance, typically in a room with good acoustics) I love Bluetooth earbuds by Marshall, Apple Inc (Apple Airpods), BOSE and Beats Audio because of balanced bass & treble. I am mostly into blues from the 60s and 70s, hard rock from the 80s, and sometimes country and folk rock musical genres. Hence, finding an alternative to the Apple Airpods within budget was a little difficult until some research and recommendations help me in my purchasing decision. I have always hated deep bass as it muffles background music. But boAt AIRDOPES 121v2 won my heart as it has got balanced treble and bass which is perfectly ideal for the kind of musical genre I am into. Also, my playlist has some dubstep and chill music which also sound great on these earbuds. I have also shared a screenshot of how it connects well with the laptop.",Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 1 October 2022

4.0,Great buy for the price,It is absolutely lightweight and comfortable to wear. Easy to set up and use. The battery indicator LED on the case is very helpful. I use it mainly for listening to audio while walking around so it serves the purpose very well. Tried WhatsApp call with it but the other side said there was a lot of feedback and echo from my end so am not using it for calls. But totally happy with it as a comfy companion for walks using one ear only and for doing chores around the house with these on.,Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 26 July 2022

5.0,Bang for your buck!,"I bought these in the great indian sale for ₹999TLDR;- Good sound and mic- Comfortable- Good quality- Decent battery life- Value for moneyFull review:- Firstly, the build quality. It feels sturdy and has magnets for the lid as well as the buds themselves. The case also has a satisfying click when closed :)- The buds are very lightweight and fit comfortably in the ears.- As soon as you pull out a bud from the case, it will get connected if you've paired with a device. As soon as you put it back in the case it'll disconnect. The magnet is strong and doesn't open when dropped :p- Sound quality is excellent for the price. If you connect with a device and the sound quality is bad or breaking, try closing any tabs/apps using the mic. Bluetooth headsets loose quality when mic is being used.- The percent displayed on the case is beautiful. Also very useful to know how much charge is left in the case. The charge left on the buds can be check on the paired device- The device works in mono or stereo, depending on how many buds are outside the case.- The box was sealed with shrinkwrap as well as two plastic seals, one on either sides.- There is one clickable button on each bud, which multifunctions as play/pause, accept calls, google assistant trugger, turn on/off, and reset settings- The mic quality is apparantly good as well, based on my conversation with a friend- With low to moderate usage these have lasted over 3 days now, with 100% on the buds and 20% on the case- BoAt also seems to have good after sales support. One of friends had had his headphones replaced a few times. And they have physical service centers available.All in all these buds are a bang for your buck10/10 would buy again",Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 6 November 2020

 Though I see many negative reviews around here, my product is fairly good. Like, I purchased it before going to hostel, initially they used to fell easily, it fell from even 2 floors, broke into 2 halves, but it was fixed at the same time just by pressing. The charging box also fell a decent number of times, there was time it got loose but it got fixed up without doing anything.Build Quality is good enough 4.5/5 (for a person like me who's not good at handling phone and earbuds)Mic is just useless (1/5)Sound Quality is decent, good enough (3.5/5)Battery backup lasts for 2days atleast. (3.5/5)Bluetooth range is fairly comparable to my headphones. (3/5)Charging indicator is sometimes not accurate (4/5)An earbud can't be better than a headphone. You can still use it for gaming. It has fairly low/decent latency.Value for Money (3/5)Update after 9 months of using:I contacted them regarding warranty claim, but they never provided any acknowledgement regarding it, and just ignored my complaints for 3 months, and couldn't arrange a pickup and blamed me later for asking warranty claim of item, after it went out of waranty. I don't know what they were high on.When you purchase any of their product, just remember they're just like micromax, they don't have any actual warranty and I had faced the same issue twice.",21 July 2022

4.0,"Superb Bass, Sound Quality, Matt finish. Make is Sturdy. Connectivity I give 3 stars","I bought these Airdopes by Beat on Amazon during the Diwali 2020 offer at a dirt cheap price of Rs. 999 only. The product arrived in a tight sealed box in a good condition. The case is nice & compact (your one finger size) with boat printed on top and a charging slot at its back. The box came with its own charging wire & some extra buds. At first the case opens and shuts looking a bit loose, but its just magnetic, so you'll get used to it.For a day or so the airdopes will consume enough battery from the case, which is normal as it even happens with new phones. So give it time. After a day, it performs better. So, if you charge the case to 100% and keep the earbuds inside the case, the battery drops really slow. Which is good. There is a digital display inside the case indicating the battery level and while charging it blinks as well, so you can see the charge level. (This was all about the case and while the pods are inside it).About the earbuds/pods itself, the aesthetics are sober, matt finished, and very sturdy even if you drop it hard. Comfortable to wear in my ears for prolonged hours. Both the earbuds have a click button where boat is written. With one click you can play/pause, attend a call, or with long press do various functions. There is no volume control (main drawback). Sound quality and bass is fantastic. Bluetooth connectivity is really good if the phone/laptop/any device is in close proximity. I gave 3 stars for connectivity coz the connectivity drops as I move from one room to another and need to have my phone in clear path or close to me. So, that's a bit annoying if you're on a call. But as soon as you come into the range of your device, it connects automatically and instantly. Keeping it balanced. It's great for music, watching movies, videos, call experience is ok ok (need to talk a bit loudly or cover your mouth for better experience). Battery life of the earbuds is fantastic. I use it for upto 24 hours or more at a single charge. I bought it mainly for music experience. Been over a month I'm using it just fine. No complaints.",Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 14 December 2020

Today 27 July so its 3 month review. I never use any earbuds before that so I cant compare. On fresh user besis it's great product in sound, bass, look, charging time(max 2 & half hour if 0%). I use it from morning 10 am to night 8 pm after charged 100% (not continuously) still it's on 7%. Active noise cancellation(ANC) is also good. Cant hear a voice front perons voice not totally. Its fall accidentally by myself and I see it's the dismental parts so got worried but that's not issue you can assemble it carefully. Take a time for assemble. Don't rush. After that incident still working good. Check it properly its fit in ear or not. This earbuds have a button so you can use it without confusion and easy. Just single press for stop music attend/cut call double press play music.  Different music play for call in earbuds. Battery indicator is a great feature. I still not configure a range coz never  far away from mobile so may be 7-8 meter. In the box just a old usb charging cable without adapter.

I'm using it about 2 hours continuously but still there's charge remaining...Buttons quality also are good, but feels so much clicky.I also dropped it once from about 3 to 4 feets but it survive that, just case cap opened and earsbuds are chilling under the bed...Build quality is quite good. The plastic used is decent, scratches appears easily.One thing is that the case cap is so loose.

3.0,Go For It if you can get it at lesser price,"I Got it at a price of ₹ 750 via Amazon Pay LaterAt this price point it is far better than any tws or neckbands , but don't buy for ₹ 1100 it is not worth it , if your budget is greater than ₹ 1000 then go for any other model tws in boat or any other brandsPros : ( @ ₹750 price point)1. It's a great tws with good sound & bass2. Connects immediately with you device  whenever you take the buds outside the case  except for the first time3. Fits in your ear perfectly but there is a  disadvantage I'll tell you at the cons.Cons :1. If you're using the buds for the first time you  might feel some pain in your ears , but it  won't last long after using it for multiple  times2. The earbuds might slip out from your ears in  two conditions  (a) if your ears are wet ( i.e : during workout  and after bath  (b) if you are sleeping with the earbuds on  your either side of ear3. No Noise Cancellation4. The Lid of the case is very loose , it might  come out at any time5. Connectivity is very poor , the range is  mentioned as 10m but it's getting  disconnected even in my trouser pocket.6. Call Quality is very worst , if your buying this  for calling purpose don't buy it",Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 23 October 2021

5.0,Great sound quality but not the most comfortable.,"This was the first wireless earbuds I ever bought. Safe to say, I was thoroughly impressed and will stick to wireless earphones from now on.𝗣𝗿𝗼𝘀:• Great sound quality. Music on this is fantastic. Although the noise cancellation isn't perfect, it doesn't let in enough ambient noise to affect your enjoyment of the music. As a fan of rock music, guitar riffs, drum beats and bass lines are brilliant on these headphones.• Good battery life. There aren't much to wireless headphones. Audio quality and battery life are the two technical aspects. The battery life on this product is very long. I use regularly for an hour or two per day and the battery lasts over a week usually.𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘀:• Not the most comfortable or clean. The rubber buds sometimes press into the inner ear and can slightly hurt your inner ear. The grooves on the pod also accumulate dirt a lot. It requires regular cleaning after prolonged use.Although much newer models are out, this product is a nifty device which helped grow the earbud market.",19 July 2022

This feedback is based on regular usage of approx 2-3 hrs per day.I cannot even imagine doing a workout with these. So flimsy, poor quality product.

Lovely case with battery indicator on the charging case, the airdopes are of same color as case , the bud fits in each ear though can fall off easily on any movement. Handbook and wc provided. But all this doesn’t fulfill the quality of sound and Bluetooth connectivity by this particular earbuds- It’s very poor and keeps crackling even if the phone kept at close proximity or in pocket. The other person on line cannot receive the conversation and conveyed in bits pieces making a complete phone conversation very difficult- this is on stationary premises; travelling or vehicle commute might make it worse. Having 3-4 different brands hands free EarPods/earbuds, this by far is the least Bluetooth connectivity, poor service- overall not good investment.",16 March 2022

3.0,Good but not the Best!,"It's been more than 2 months since I've purchased this airdopes and they work really good till date...Although the sound quality is good but if u r aiming for an airdopes with noise cancellation as one of it's feature then this is not the one that u must go for! From my experience, I could literally here each and every external sound clearly enough to distract my concentration while I was attending my online classes😂 The Quality of the product is really good and appreciable but the mic quality of the airdopes is kinda horrible especially during phone calls... But using it for a long time now, I'm quite adjusted and comfortable with this product..lastly I can say that this product is good despite having some drawbacks as it can be used for long-term...And Oh yeah! Not to forget, the battery is also average (not the best) but it's kinda funny to say that the charge gets reduced to 30% within few hours (after being completely charged to 100%)but once it gets 30%, it's lyk the charge stops decreasing and u can use the airdopes for another 2-3 hours..i hope u r understanding what I'm tryna say... And that's all I had to tell, I hope this helps u🖤",15 September 2021

3.0,Got it for 900,Product came as it is.. but it's mic is very very poor.. I had seen people talking very slowly also while using such pods so I thought to buy one but you need to scream or speak louder than you would usually do on phone aur wired earphone for the other person to hear you.. if u pause your music frequently then it might get disconnected on it's own or it would show it's connected but there would b no music.. then you turn off and on your bluetooth and keep the pods in case and then connect it again for listening again.&Once charged it could be used for good 4-5 hours that's what I have seen in my case.. I mean it's battery drained from 80 to 35 while one complete movie and continuous youtube sessions..,9 November 2021
4.0,Terrific purchase,"I've been using this product for almost six months now. I must say it is a supperb product by Boat. I always had an issue with the wired earphones as they stop working fast and it becomes difficult and time consuming to untangle them . But now as soon as I get these earbuds out of the box they connect to my device within 2-3 seconds. Talking about the sound quality it was decent and it enhances the quality of sound by its noice cancellation. It doesn't get out of the ears while dancing, exercising, jogging etc. I use it while I'm riding. Recently one of the earphone fell from my hand directly on the ground. Now I can feel something shaky inside while I'm running but the sound quality is the same. Boat should work on its built quality. Anyways for those who are switching from a wireless earphone to tws,this earphone is the best. It's cheaper, it has great battery backup and a branding like BOAT.",14 June 2021

1.0,"Unreliable, and boAt after sales support is a nightmare! OK before it inevitably stops working.","There are quality/reliability issues with this model. One of the earbuds stopped charging within the 10 day replacement period itself. The replacement product worked fine for 5 months, and then the same issue occurred and one of the earbuds stopped charging again. I think it was the same left earbud in both cases.I took it to boAt service center and they replaced my black Airdopes with the cherry blossom color since they  claimed to not have the black model available. However this doesn't reflect in the boAt records anywhere. The sound quality for this cherry blossom replacement was not upto the mark so I contacted customer care and they said they could not provide support for this cherry blossom replacement, provided by their own service center, as my model was supposed to be black in color. Telephone support was no help in this case, they even claimed that the replacement ticket filed by service center was for a cherry blossom model. So between their support and service centers, the end consumer gets taken for a ride.boAt is supposed to provide 1 year warranty however my 5 month old Airdopes are now out of warranty since they won't support their own service center replacements.The interesting thing I learned is that the 1 year boAt warranty is only on the original product, boAt can keep providing you faulty replacements for faulty original product, but after 1 year from original date of purchase they have no liability whatsoever. So effective lifetime of product is 1 year since it will stop working much sooner.UPDATE: I had to go via Twitter but did finally receive replacement pair - cherry blossom ones. They even shipped them to my home. The mic quality has never been what it was in my original black pair though, and I mostly don’t use my Airdopes as much as I initially did.",Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 24 March 2022

4.0,Great listening experience at a pocket-friendly price,"Bought this at ₹999, reviewing it after 3-4 days of usage. Huge fan of the colour, the case cap was not loose, which seemed a common complaint among other buyers. It autoconnects to devices once paired, which is very convenient. Battery life is amazing, have been using it for about 6-7 hours without charging it. Sound quality is great, not phenomenal- but above average for the price. Only issues I face are that the audio is interrupted sometimes if you move too far away from your device. Also, I'm not able to control the volume while connected to my laptop. One thing to remember is that the MFB is a button, and not touch interface.Update after two weeks of use: sometimes doesn't connect to devices, have to switch BT on and off. Doesn't process audio from mulitple sources at once, unlike regular earphones or headphones, i.e, if I'm on a video call, it won't pick up audio from other tabs/apps in the background :/ Battery life has definitely reduced.TL;DR- definitely worth it overall, at this price.",Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 29 January 2021

Another annoying factor is the battery life.

3.0,Not so good,The person on the other end can hardly hear you when you are using this airdopes for calling.... there is no noise cancellation on the background ....Good for using while watching something on the phone,Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 25 April 2022
4.0,The charging case also holds capacity of 14hrs.,So the charging case also holds capacity of 14hrs alongwith 3.5hrs of the airdopes. So when your airdopes are in the case they are self charging 😬Once charged fully it runs smoothly for about 7-10days without needing to charge which is what I liked the most in the product. Sound quality and noise cancellation are also decent. Great product at a decent price.,Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 2 January 2022

Case lead fills bit loose and very sensitive to scratches.Comfort:Earbuds feels bit pointy but it could be just me. And they DO NOT HAVE MUCH GRIP IN EAR. I have dropped them accidentally several times. They fell off easily even with moderate head swings.Battery Backup:It takes around 2 hours to fully charge the case. Earbuds lasts around 4 hours on medium volume. I got total back up of around 10 hours.Summary:If you are looking for budget ear buds I would suggest to go for this, But be careful people are getting refurbished/returned product.

 Received safely along with all original packaging, w-card, instructions etc. been using for few weeks.sound quality is excellent. cute carry-on case with charging. The back-up is straight 7-8 hrs (3-4hr aprox for continue movies and songs) and the carry case is itself a on-the-go charger.. so total back-up we can say is approx 10-12 hrs or more.sound, bass, noice cancellation, battery backup everything is perfect .. but the fitting..Its not comfortable to wear, easily falls off. I have to be always alert while wearing it. so thats a big nono for this product.The boxy shape doesn't fits inside the ear cavity that well. the earplug holds a bit but the design looses its fit.With consideration of all its good qualities, the design of product seems big fail. some holder attachement might help a bit.",18 March 2021

But not deal breaker.While the manual says the dock can charge the pods a couple of times, practically it can at best charge twice. Not very impressive.The fitting is also not very snug. Has high chances of falling off if you are not careful.The real deal breaker is connectivity.The pod keeps losing connectivity every 20-25 mins while watching a movie (haven't experienced it over calls) and it is quite irritation. Haven't figured out the reason yet. I need to wait for it to reconnect again, which it does.Call quality is also not very happening. The mic is not very sensitive and hence we need to talk louder to make ourselves heard.Overall, I would suggest that you pay slightl more and go for a better model.",23 January 2021

5.0,best budget wireless earbuds ever bought,"one of the amazing purchase i ever made. for me, battery backup is about 7 hour 28 minutes per single charge at listening to music @70% volume. ear buds takes around 40-50 min to get charged from case @ consuming only 23% battery from case. so theoretically i can charge them upto 4.3 times.  case itself takes around 1 hour 20 min to get from 7% to 100% . my unit only shows charging upto 80% then it stays at 80%. but this is a glitch as I can assure it charges little more than that.pro:1. best battery life. upto 37 hour of music.2. charging time is great. 40 min from 0-100%3. built quality is good. never had problem connecting with any device. added bonus they work in mono mode too.con:1. lack of next/previous/volume up/down on ear buds. you can only control volume through your phone.2. sound cancellation is just OK.3. fitting is good. they will not fall off ear in everyday situation. but still cannot use when joging or doing any exercise. as there is not extra protection against fall.4. bass is non existent as in case of most of the budget wireless earbuds.at 999 rs it is best deal one could ever wish. truly happy and satisfied by them at this price range.p.s. this company is a German brand not Chinese.",Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 2 March 2021

5.0,Great value for money in the category,"This is a review for Airdopes 121v2 (version 2). For the price they are going at, ₹1300, at the time of writing this review, these offer great value.I was looking for earbuds that I could use (in mono mode) while riding a motorcycle, for directions and such; more so because my bike has the connected bike feature. So, my expectations from the buds were quite functional.But, surprisingly, these buds are good for listening to music too.Sound quality: The bass is good, and the treble and range are decent.Set up / pairing was easy and needed no additional effort.The LED display which shows the charge remaining in the case is a useful feature to help you to leave the house with full charge on. Again going back to my basic need for use on the motorcycle in mono mode, I expect that by alternating L and R pods, i can double the use per charge.So, overall happy with the buy. Long term reliability needs to be seen. But 20k+ high ratings tell me I have little to worry about.",Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 26 August 2021

5.0,Worth your money to buy. Go for it.,"Bought this on Great Indian Festival Offer for ₹999 as Mrp was ₹2,999. I was so impressed & convinced with my decision of buying this instead of Redmi Earbuds 2C for ₹1,299.1) Case quality - Made of plastic. Looks premium but neither so good nor bad.2) Buds - They are so small & light weight. Buds size will be average for 20+ years age, but might be little big for people whose ears are small.3) Connectivity - Has Bluetooth 5.0, so no worries about connection loss, but common distance is 10m.4) Sound Quality - Sound is good but not so great @ this price range. Bass is decent, Trebles are good, mids & lows are Ok. Call quality is good without any voice break.5) Battery - Battery life is good, will give you around 3-3.5hrs playback on a single charge. Case give you 3 full times charging for the buds. Main highlight is the battery percentage which most brands doesn't give. Really good.6) Brand - Boat is one of the best brand in market for audio accessories. This brand never fails to give it's best for the customer. 1 year international warranty provided & service centres are good.Final verdict - Overall I would say if the buds price is ₹999 & your budget is under ₹1000, then definitely go for it. You won't regret buying it. But if this buds price goes over 1000+ then check for other options.Peace ✌️",Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 13 November 2020

I think its a BT connectivity issue,which should not be , in this case..the charger case also needs a slow speed charging point to charge itself,as mentioned in the booklet. Or else, you might end up damaging the entire item.It doesnt hv any remote to increase/ decrease volume....so everytime, phone as to be used change song.",20 December 2020

3.0,A decent product for the price,"Sound quality: There are better wired headsets with better sound quality in this price range. However this is one of the best true wireless headset in its category.Fit in the ear: The ear buds with this product is not upto the level of its competitors. Even boat has headsets with better ear buds in this price range (wired headsets).Connectivity: In the 3 months that I used, never faced any bluetooth connectivity issues. The headset works as a single earpiece as well as double earpiece. The 2nd earpiece automatically syncs with the other pair when taken out of the case.Battery life: Comfortably gives more that 10hrs of playback time. And gives a very decent standby time.Quality of the case: Saw some reviews saying the case lid is bad. However, the quality of the case seemed to be same as that for OnePlus buds which sells at 3 times the price.",24 February 2021

4.0,Quality control Needs improvement but otherwise Good Buds for the price with adequate sound quality.,"The earphones itself is good.but Quality control is non existent. My case and the right earbud was slightly scratched out of the box. But nothing that will effect the usability of the buds.The case seems solid, The lid feels cheap tho. The earbuds itself is a bit on the chunky side so if you want something smaller I'd suggest the Redmi Buds 2C.The audio quality is good with good bass and they fit decently comfortable in your ears.Connectivity is easy to set up and automatically connects if you take one pod out of the case after initial setup and pairing.one slightly annoying thing I've noticed is that you can't skip a track if you're using only one pod.",15 December 2020

But the product itself is very average. The design and battery backup is good. However, the Bluetooth connectivity is very weak and its best operated at 2X the wired distance. Anything beyond, the mic refuses to send voice to the device. Overall, I did not like the performance. It compares well with other cheaper options available under 1k.  Most feedback here seem a bit overrated.The replacement I received had only a single replacement ear bud. The first one had four. Seems they are just repacking returned items.",21 June 2021

Earbud fully charged battery discharges in just 1-2 hours.5. One earbud has stopped working in just 6-7 months and now another earbud has started making lot of noises automatically and seems it will also stop working in next few days.6. Case battery life after 6-7 months is around charging 2-3 times both the earbud  only. One earbud full charging drains around 25% battery of the case.,4 August 2022

Calls ok but that too if you are kind of business guys then again no :)2. Right airdopes was having low volume and there is no way to increase it.3. The Mic was not clear enough.. the other end caller was not able to hear me properly and was asked to repeat the same twice each time.4.  The buttons on the airdopes was hard such that i had to take out press it and then fit it back to my ears.5. Left airdopes kept disconnecting frequently.",25 November 2021

2.0,The bass is terrific but not the ideal buy!,"To start off, for the price the boat earbuds hasn't disappointed. The sound and bass is terrific. Compact design and the battery life is worth mentioning about. But all said, Bluetooth connectivity is not as strong as the description say. Manual connection of the left and the right ear bud respectively to be done when connecting the device to your phone. It sure does fit in the ear when you not moving much, but it tends to fall out while you out for a run or when you at the gym.Overall, a good pocket-friendly set of earbuds if you haven't had one before, but it sure is a hassle when you have to fix them to stay in your ear during your work outs or a jog as mentioned earlier. Also if you ride a motorcycle, it surely does not fit inside the helmet. Hence, weigh other alternatives before jumping to buy these just for the price.. Cheers!",19 September 2021

(2) The Boat company should cut down on its gender biasing and especially colour biasing.The customers have to pay an additional sum of Rs. 353/- if they opt for the pink coloured ones instead of the regular black for this device. This is called the Pink Tax from which this company is benefitting unethically.I recommend not to buy the product.,Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 23 February 2022

4.0,Pros and a con,The airdopes are nicely built and easy to use. They fit in perfectly over the ear and was also steady enough to not fall off during a jog. It comes with a case for the airdopes which is also used as a charger case with the battery display. I only have an issue with the battery level display which shows up in the box. Sometimes the airdopes signals a low battery while being used on ear but shows around 35-37% battery when put back in the box.,23 March 2021

1.0,Useless product that didn't last for even 6 months,"Boat has mastered the art of selling defective/substandard products through various sales on different online platforms. While it does seem like a great option to buy these at discounted prices, the product doesn't always turn out to be good. Can say from personal experience of having used 3 boat products. Boat Rockerz 335,385, ear dopes 121., All three didn't last more than 6 months. While boat does provide a replacement if the product has failed in less than 1 year, it is useless because they will replace it with an equally substandard product which will fail again in 6 months and your warranty has expired by then. Better spend a little more and buy a quality product than spend on a substandard one. Highly disappointed.",Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 24 July 2022

3.0,Disappointed with boAt as a brand; not worth the money.,"The sound quality in general isn't great. The bass in the right ear piece is skewed, causing the sound to split even at medium volume. Battery life is so-so.Also, it keeps falling out of the ear which is superr bad coz you can lose it and have no way to trace it.Sometimes it has trouble connecting but the typical ""switch off and on"" usually resolves it.Bottomline, better to stick with their regular bluetooth earphones instead of these since you cant know quality without using and then on using you can't return it.",Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 6 February 2021

2.0,"Poor microphone, decent sound quality of hearing","While this is one of the very sleek looking pods in the market, it certainly doesnt have a good microphone, and hence cannot be used for making phone calls. The person at the other end keeps saying that the voice is muffled / not clear, and the moment I disconnected the pods in the same position, they could hear me clearly.I bought one pair, and returned it due to this reason, and bought another pair of the same earphones. However, even for the second pair, the same issue persists that the person at the other end cannot hear clearly. I even tried removing one pod from one ear and keeping the other one close to my mouth, but there was no improvement.I would not recommend this product unless this issue is fixed. However, if you are using the pod ONLY for hearing music, then it is a decent buy.",Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 28 August 2021

Important is how to use it. Choose the right size rubber grips to fit in your ears else just press it a little properly to experience the quality of sound.Most importantly use a music player and equaliser settings of your mobile when you want experience the quality of sound. It is wrong to judge the sound quality by listening music on online apps.That's alll.

2.0,Very poor mic,"The quality of the mic is very poor and the person on the other side can not hear anything properly even when I was indoor with no noise around me. I also did not receive extra ear tips in the box. Build quality is okay for the price. Sound quality for music is good for the price. But it lacks terribly in the most basic use, that is how this product's mic sounds, which is very very poor. I never used of heard of any product which can be this bad on mic. Rs.50 earphones have better mic. I was going to throw it in the garbage area in front of our house, but trying to replace the product and see if the other one is little better. The problem is, they focused on splash proofing the product and there is no gap for the voice to go in. It is totally muffed. It sounds like mic is under a pillow and person is talking through the pillow. Don't buy it. Spend little extra and get realme buds q may be",9 February 2021

1.0,Not very user friendly and Convenient Ear phones,"First thing first it is not returnable but only replaceable. So if it doesn't suit you, there is no point of replacement. Second thing is, one need to really make efforts to take the ear drops out from the box. They cant't be taken out so easily and some times fall down in the process.  The size of the covers provided with the ear drops is not suitable for small size ears. Even while using with the smallest size of covers, it drops from the ears. You may visualise the discomfort and difficulty in case you are using during travel in a Bus, Train or Aircraft and with little bit of shaking of head if it drops then you had it. The Battery life is very low, after three months of usage, the Battery goes down to 50% by just keeping in the charging box for 2-3 days even when you don't use. Another difficult part is while you are in a zoom or google meet attending some meeting or conversation and if you try and adjust its position in the ears, the top buttons of the ear drops are so big and sensitive that with light touch of your fingers, it gets you disconnected from the meeting or conversation. It's a big problem as you need to make efforts to connect to the meeting all over again. So as I said not very user friendly and convenient at all.",20 March 2021

This is common in some good earphones of this type as i have experienced. Even Samsung's earphone has this problem of double voice. Have to check with noise cancelling which I am unable to check right now. Hopefully that too must be good. Overall good deal for Rs999.,Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 12 November 2020

1.0,Not worth the price they mention,"I had to revise the Ratings from 3 to 1. I so much wanted to drop it to 0 as the left ear bud committed suicide and it wont charge. So buyers think before before investing in such DUD brands.I'm being objective so it helps other buyers in making a choice.Pairing- it gets paired in an instant but at sometimes you will even find the right bud pairs and the left doesn't get on at all. It also might have to do with the seconds gap in removing the eardopes from the box. But this could have been avoided.Sound- clear ,precise. Bass could have been better. Background cancellation - pretty good when you are listening to.music ....but ..but .. not when you are on calls. People can hear an ambulance siren 300 m away . That's not background noise cancellation. This means it picks up frequencies.Grip- grips well while running. Might have come off once or twice due to sweat ..but overall grips well. Remember there is a certain way you put those buds.On and off-  this one is frustrating .. slightest touch when u feel those buds are coming out and u want to push them in... they go OFF.",Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 24 September 2021
